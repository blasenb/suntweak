# Sun Tweak #
Project Sun Tweak has been created to help people in modding this old, but stil great strategy game - Tiberian Sun. This project depends on other lower-layer projects like tsunmix, tsmix, tsmix-qt, tibsunix. First version will be released after those project reach more usable version.

# News #

## Beta hopefully soon! ##
Alpha has been compiled successfully and can provide basic TSunmix functionality. If everythings goes well, public beta will be released in next few days/weeks.

# Features #

## MIX archive tweaking ##
  * **Depends on:** tsmix, tsunmix
  * highest priority

Sun Tweak should definitely help with editing mix files. That's the main goal.

## INI editor ##
  * **Depends on:** tibsunix
  * low priority

Editing INI files is not that hard and few tools already exists, so it's not so important to develop new tool, although this part is probably easiest.

## Other features ##
I would like to provide tool providing complete tiberian sun modding support. I know that's a long run, but I hope I will be able to produce at least main features.

In final version it should enable shp, vox, tem editing. But I know nothing about these file types yet, so I can't say anything about future of this functionality now.
